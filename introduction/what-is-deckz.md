# What is Deckz.gg

**Deckz.gg** is a next-generation digital pack-opening platform that fuses the thrill of collectible trading cards with the transparency and permanence of blockchain technology.  
It’s built for players who love suspense, rarity, and competition — but expect the integrity and polish of a real-world financial product.

## A New Kind of Digital Collecting

Deckz.gg reimagines the classic joy of ripping open a booster pack. Each pack you open is more than a set of digital cards — it’s an event, a moment of chance you can prove and own.  
The cards you reveal are recorded immutably, the outcomes are deterministic, and the excitement is genuine.

### Why Deckz.gg Exists
Most digital card games rely on opaque RNG or closed economies. Deckz.gg changes that.  
Here, every pull can be verified, every currency has value, and every player has the same transparent opportunity to win something extraordinary.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Provable Fairness
Each pack result is generated through a **deterministic SpinPlan** — a pre-recorded sequence stored securely before animation begins.  
This ensures what you see is what you won: the reel simply visualizes a pre-decided, verifiable outcome.

### 2. Real & Free-to-Play Economies
Deckz.gg offers two synchronized modes:
- **Real Mode** — uses Gold Coins (linked to $DECKZ and BNB) for true stakes and tradable value.  
- **F2P Mode** — grants 100 000 demo coins so anyone can test features and experience the excitement risk-free.

### 3. Ownership That Matters
Every card, balance, and transaction is tied to your connected wallet.  
Unlike traditional games, your assets aren’t stored on a hidden server — they’re yours, and the system is designed to prove it.
